# URL_Blocker

URL Blocker for Windows
Edit the blockedUrl list in Code and run the python code from command line with admin privilages


NOTE- Remember to unblock the wesites if they get blocked by editing the working hours of code and running it again

To install the Blocker in working computers to really block URL(not for just testing), create a routine in Windows task scheduler to run the .pyw file
